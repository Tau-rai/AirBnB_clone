## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create web pages, defining structure with elements enclosed in angle brackets.
The document structure includes ```<html>```, ``<head>``, ``<title>``, ``<body>``, and various tags to organize content.

## Markup Language and DOM

HTML is a markup language with tags annotating documents.
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface allowing manipulation of a document's structure and content.

## Element/Tag and Attribute

An element is defined by start and end tags along with content.
Attributes provide additional information, specified in the start tag (e.g., ``<img src="image.jpg">``).

## Webpage Loading Process

When a URL is entered, the browser requests HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the server.
The browser renders HTML to display the webpage.

## CSS Introduction

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes the look and formatting of HTML documents.

## Styling with CSS

Style is added to HTML elements using CSS, either inline (``<p style="color:red;">``) or in a separate file.
Classes and selectors help apply styles to groups of elements.

## CSS Specificity

Specificity measures how specific a selector is, calculated based on the number of ID, class, and type selectors.

## Box Model in CSS

The CSS box model includes margins, borders, padding, and content, influencing size and display properties.
